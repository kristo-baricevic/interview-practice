## 1. One system (logistics-aligned)

**Prompt**

> Tell me about a system you built that dealt with real operational constraints.

**Strong answer**

> I built a scheduling system that assigned time-windowed work against limited daily capacity.
> Orders could be scheduled, rescheduled, canceled, or retried, and the system had to stay consistent 
> even when calls were repeated or arrived out of order.
>
> The complexity wasn’t the data structures. It was making sure capacity was never over- or 
> under-counted while still allowing flexibility when plans changed.

If interrupted with “what made it hard?”:

> The hard part was modeling state transitions so that every change had a clear before and after, 
> and nothing ended up half-applied.

## 2. One failure (operations realism)

**Prompt**

> Tell me about a failure that affected operations.

**Strong answer**

> We had a case where reschedules caused capacity to drift. Nothing crashed, but over time the system 
> thought certain windows were full when they weren’t.
>
> The root cause was that reschedule logic adjusted capacity incrementally instead of treating it as a 
> release followed by a new allocation. I fixed it by making reschedule a composed operation instead 
> of a special case.

If pressed:

> The takeaway was that “small” state adjustments accumulate. Explicit undo and redo beats clever deltas.

## 3. One tradeoff (relevant to Rinse)

**Prompt**

> What tradeoff did you make that affected performance or flexibility?

**Strong answer**

> I chose to make all order mutations synchronous and explicit, even though we could have made 
> parts asynchronous earlier.
>
> That limited throughput initially, but it gave us strong guarantees that capacity, timing, and 
> order state were always in sync. Once that was stable, async became an optimization instead 
> of a risk.

If asked why that matters:

> In logistics, being slightly slower is usually better than being wrong.

## 4. One ambiguous call (real-world ops)

**Prompt**

> Tell me about a decision you had to make without clear requirements.

**Strong answer**

> There wasn’t a clear rule for how late an order could be canceled. Instead of guessing, I made 
> cancellation rules strict and explicit and forced downstream systems to respect them.
>
> That meant saying “no” in some edge cases, but it avoided surprise capacity changes and made 
> behavior predictable for operators.

If they push back:

> You can always loosen constraints later. Tightening them after chaos is much harder.

## Close (very Rinse-friendly)

If the CTO asks “how do you think about logistics systems?”:

> I treat them like accounting systems. Every change needs a clean audit trail, and the numbers 
> should always reconcile.
