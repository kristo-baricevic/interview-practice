// Simple BFS / DFS (reachability / consistency)

// You’re given a grid representing service zones.
// 1 means the zone is serviceable, 0 means blocked.
// Count how many distinct service regions exist.

// Follow-ups
// - BFS or DFS, which do you prefer and why?
// - How would you avoid revisiting zones?
// - What changes if the grid is very large?

// What they’re testing
// - Graph traversal basics
// - Visited-state handling
// - Calm problem decomposition
