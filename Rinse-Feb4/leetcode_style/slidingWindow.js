// Sliding Window (search / filtering)

// Given a string representing a customer search query stream,
// find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

// Walk me through how you’d do this efficiently.

// Follow-ups
// - What state do you keep as the window moves?
// - Why doesn’t restarting the scan work well?
// - How would this change if the input were very large?

// What they’re testing
// - Maintaining evolving state
// - Knowing when to move left vs right pointer
// - Explaining logic clearly
