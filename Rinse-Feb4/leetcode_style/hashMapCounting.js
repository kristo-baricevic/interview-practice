// Hash Map Counting (capacity / frequency)

// You’re given a list of completed orders, each with a pickup_window_id.
// Return the pickup window that was used most frequently.
// If there’s a tie, return any.

// Follow-ups
// - What if the list is empty?
// - What if this runs continuously as new orders arrive?
// - How would you reset counts daily?

// What they’re testing
// - Choosing the right data structure
// - Simple, correct counting
// - Reasoning about extensions
