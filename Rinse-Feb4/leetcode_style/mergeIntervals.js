// Merge / Insert Intervals (time windows)

// You’re given a list of scheduled pickup windows for a driver,
// each as [start, end], sorted by start time and non-overlapping.
// A new pickup request comes in with its own window.

// Write a function that inserts the new window and merges overlaps so the schedule remains valid.

// Follow-ups they might ask
// - What if the list isn’t sorted?
// - What if the new window doesn’t overlap anything?
// - Why is this safe to do greedily?

// What they’re testing
// - Time window reasoning
// - Clean iteration
// - Avoiding edge-case bugs at boundaries
