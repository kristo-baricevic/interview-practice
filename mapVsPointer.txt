3) Map vs Pointer Decision Drill

I’ll give scenarios. You say the approach.

## Unsorted array, need two numbers that sum to target

Answer: Map

Why: No ordering guarantee.

## Sorted array, need to find a pair

Answer: Two pointers

Why: Order lets you move deterministically.

## Count occurrences of items

Answer: Map

Why: You need associated values.

## Remove duplicates in place from sorted data

Answer: Two pointers

Why: Adjacent duplicates, constant space.

## Sliding window with uniqueness only

Answer: Set

Why: Presence matters, not counts or indices.
